# video-frame-extractor-FE-demo

## TODO
- Apply "frame" and "margin"
    - design with figma first
    - make the frame to be fixed, the photos will be located inside the fixed square
    - give options to choose (photo aspect ratio, square or 4:3)
    - move the photo location to be slightly right


- Trim video functionality
- Flow: Video upload -> Crop -> Extract to 20~40 frames at once --> edit = crop/trim both -> frames auto extracted at once
- Upload to google drive, progress bar ==> n8n & slack, cross check with google sheets DB (if Cx ordered)
- Flipping speed config; 1second for 10 frames for now, adjustment required
- Book cover design (front / back)
